This includes constructing prompts, storing them, and ensuring they are used effectively to get the desired responses from the language models.\\n\\n3. **Chains**: LangChain introduces the concept of \"chains,\" which are sequences of calls that can include both LLMs and other utility functions. Chains enable the creation of more sophisticated and multi-step workflows, enhancing the capabilities of applications.\\n\\n4. **Data Augmented Generation**: This feature allows for the integration of external data into the generation process. By fetching relevant information from various data sources, the LLM can produce more accurate and contextually appropriate results.\\n\\n5. **Agents**: LangChain supports the development of agents that can make decisions based on user input. These agents leverage LLMs to process input and determine appropriate actions, facilitating interactive and intelligent applications.\\n\\n6. **Memory**: To enable stateful interactions, LangChain includes components for managing memory. This allows applications to maintain context over multiple interactions, improving user experience in conversational interfaces.\\n\\n7. **Evaluation**: LangChain provides tools for evaluating the performance of LLM applications, helping developers refine and optimize their implementations.\\n\\nOverall, LangChain is aimed at making it easier to harness the capabilities of large language models in a structured and efficient manner, paving the way for the creation of advanced, LLM-powered applications.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 376, 'prompt_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 398}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3aa7262c27', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-35f2a315-a00e-42a5-bb76-06f7e0eba89a-0'\n"
